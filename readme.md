### Project Description
This is our assignment submission for CSE 3122Y - Distributed and Cloud Computing Semester 1, a basic online pizza ordering application consisting of a TCP server and a JavaFX client to allow customers to place their orders. An additional unfinished client for managing orders is included as well.

This assignment was done in less than 2 days therefore there are some key aspects missing such as form validation.
